	Finding HTML Elements
Often, with JavaScript, you want to manipulate HTML elements.

To do so, you have to find the elements first. There are several ways to do this:

Finding HTML elements by id
Finding HTML elements by tag name
Finding HTML elements by class name
Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors
Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections

<h1>Finding HTML Element by Id</h1>

<p id="demo"> 1st Paragraph</p>
<p id="demo_1"> 2nd Paragraph</p>
<p> 3rd Paragraph </p>

<button type="button" onclick="f1()">Click Me</button>

<script type="text/javascript">
	function f1(){
		var p1 = document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML;

		document.getElementById("demo_1").innerHTML = "The Text from 1st paragraph " + " - " + p1; 
	}
</script>
